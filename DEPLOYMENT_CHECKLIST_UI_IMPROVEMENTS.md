## 🌩️ CLOUDPEPPER DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### 1. Pre-Installation (On CloudPepper Server)
```bash
# SSH into CloudPepper server
ssh cloudpepper-admin@stagingtry.cloudpepper.site

# Install Python dependencies
pip install qrcode num2words pillow

# Verify installation
python -c "import qrcode; import num2words; from PIL import Image; print('All dependencies OK')"
```

### 2. Module Upload
- Upload `account_payment_final/` folder to CloudPepper addons directory
- Ensure all files are properly transferred
- Check file permissions (644 for files, 755 for directories)

### 3. Module Installation
```bash
# Via Odoo UI:
1. Go to Apps menu
2. Update Apps List
3. Search for "Enhanced Payment Voucher"
4. Click Install

# Via command line (alternative):
odoo -d your_database -i account_payment_final --stop-after-init
```

### 4. Post-Installation Verification
```bash
# Check UI improvements:
1. Navigate to Accounting → Payments
2. Create new payment → Verify form field improvements
3. Add invoice lines → Verify table readability improvements
4. Test on mobile device → Verify responsive design
5. Check accessibility → Verify screen reader compatibility
```
