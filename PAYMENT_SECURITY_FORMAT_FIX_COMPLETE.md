# 🔧 Payment Security Format Correction - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Successfully corrected the severely corrupted payment_security.xml file that contained mixed XML/CSV content and separated it into properly structured files with OSUS Properties branding.

## Issues Found & Fixed ✅

### 1. **File Structure Corruption**
- ❌ **Original Issue**: payment_security.xml contained mixed content (XML + CSV + additional data files)
- ✅ **Fixed**: Separated into proper file structure:
  - `security/payment_security.xml` - Security groups and rules only
  - `security/ir.model.access.csv` - Access control matrix  
  - `data/payment_sequence.xml` - Sequence configurations
  - `data/mail_template_data.xml` - Email templates

### 2. **Module Reference Errors**
- ❌ **Original Issue**: Incorrect module references (`account_payment_final`)
- ✅ **Fixed**: Updated to correct module name (`payment_approval_pro`)

### 3. **Security Architecture Enhancement**
- ✅ **Added**: Enhanced security rules for different approval stages
- ✅ **Added**: Company-based access controls
- ✅ **Added**: Approval history and QR verification security
