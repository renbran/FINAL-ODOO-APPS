    Test that demonstrates the fix for the payment approval singleton issue.
    
    The issue was:
    - action_post() method accessed self.state without ensuring singleton
    - When multiple payments (410, 411, 412) were processed together, it failed
    
    The fix:
    - Iterate through each payment individually: for payment in self:
    - Access payment.state instead of self.state for each record
