LOCKED FIELD FIX - IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT

PROBLEM RESOLVED:
Field 'locked' used in modifier 'readonly' (state == 'cancel' or locked) must be present in view but is missing

SOLUTION APPLIED:
✅ Added <field name="locked" invisible="1"/> to header replacement
✅ Maintains all existing functionality
✅ Satisfies Odoo view validation requirements

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

1. IMMEDIATE ACTION:
   - Upload updated order_net_commission folder to CloudPepper
   - The locked field is now included in the view

2. INSTALL MODULE:
   - Go to Apps > Update Apps List
   - Search "Order Net Commission"
   - Click Install (should work without validation errors)

3. VERIFICATION:
   - Module installs successfully
   - No field validation errors
   - Workflow buttons appear correctly
   - Commission calculation works

TECHNICAL DETAILS:

The 'locked' field is a standard Odoo sale.order field that controls:
- Record locking for editing
- Readonly modifiers throughout the view
- Business logic validation

By adding it as invisible to our header, we:
✅ Satisfy view validation requirements
✅ Maintain original functionality  
✅ Keep our custom workflow intact
✅ Ensure CloudPepper compatibility

STATUS: READY FOR IMMEDIATE CLOUDPEPPER DEPLOYMENT
