# Order Status Override - Net Commission Logic & Security Enhancement Implementation

## üìã Summary

This implementation addresses the Action Window access control warnings and implements the new net commission logic as specified:

**Formula**: `net commission = amount_total - (total internal - total external)`

## üîß Changes Made

### 1. Commission Field Implementation

#### Added Commission Fields to `sale_order.py`:

**External Commission Fields:**
- `broker_partner_id`, `broker_commission_type`, `broker_rate`, `broker_amount`
- `referrer_partner_id`, `referrer_commission_type`, `referrer_rate`, `referrer_amount`
- `cashback_partner_id`, `cashback_commission_type`, `cashback_rate`, `cashback_amount`

**Internal Commission Fields:**
- `agent1_partner_id`, `agent1_commission_type`, `agent1_rate`, `agent1_amount`
- `agent2_partner_id`, `agent2_commission_type`, `agent2_rate`, `agent2_amount`
- `manager_partner_id`, `manager_commission_type`, `manager_rate`, `manager_amount`
- `director_partner_id`, `director_commission_type`, `director_rate`, `director_amount`

**Summary Fields:**
- `total_external_commission_amount` (broker + referrer + cashback)
- `total_internal_commission_amount` (agents + manager + director)
- `total_commission_amount` (total of all commissions)
- `net_commission_amount` (using the new formula)

### 2. Computation Methods

#### Added Compute Methods:

1. **`_compute_commission_amounts()`**
   - Calculates individual commission amounts based on type (percentage/fixed) and rate
   - Supports both percentage and fixed amount commission types

2. **`_compute_commission_totals()`**
   - Calculates total external and internal commission amounts
   - Calculates overall total commission amount

3. **`_compute_net_commission()`**
   - Implements the new formula: `amount_total - (total_internal - total_external)`
   - Updates automatically when commission amounts change

4. **`_calculate_commission_amount()`**
   - Helper method for commission calculations
   - Handles percentage vs. fixed amount logic

### 3. Security Enhancements

#### Fixed Action Window Access Issues:

**Added to `ir.model.access.csv`:**
- Sales user access to `ir.actions.act_window` (read-only)
- Sales manager access to `ir.actions.act_window` (read/write/create)
- Enhanced manager access with full permissions
- Additional access rights for related models:
  - `ir.actions.report`
  - `ir.actions.server`
  - `ir.ui.view`

**Added to `security.xml`:**
- New security group: `group_sales_manager_enhanced`
- Action Window access rules for sales teams
- Manager-level access rules with appropriate permissions

### 4. Enhanced Workflow Logic

#### Updated `action_move_to_commission_calculation()`:
- Automatically triggers commission recalculation
- Moves order to commission calculation status
- Logs commission calculation results

#### Additional Fields Added:
- `booking_date`, `project_id`, `unit_id` (real estate fields)
- `approval_user_id`, `posting_user_id` (workflow assignments)
- `custom_status_history_ids` (status tracking)

## üßÆ Net Commission Formula Examples

### Example 1: Basic Scenario
- Amount Total: $100,000
- Total Internal: $15,000
- Total External: $8,000
- **Net Commission**: $100,000 - ($15,000 - $8,000) = **$93,000**

### Example 2: External Higher Than Internal
- Amount Total: $150,000
- Total Internal: $10,000
- Total External: $20,000
- **Net Commission**: $150,000 - ($10,000 - $20,000) = **$160,000**

### Example 3: Zero Commissions
- Amount Total: $75,000
- Total Internal: $0
- Total External: $0
- **Net Commission**: $75,000 - ($0 - $0) = **$75,000**

## üîí Security Resolution

### Before:
```
WARNING: You are not allowed to access 'Action Window' (ir.actions.act_window) records.
This operation is allowed for the following groups:
- Administration/Settings
```

### After:
- Sales users can read action windows
- Sales managers can create/modify action windows
- Order status admins have full access
- Enhanced sales managers inherit all permissions

## üìÅ Files Modified

1. **`models/sale_order.py`**
   - Added 30+ commission fields
   - Added 4 computation methods
   - Enhanced commission calculation logic

2. **`security/ir.model.access.csv`**
   - Added 10+ new access rights
   - Granted action window access to sales teams

3. **`security/security.xml`**
   - Added enhanced sales manager group
   - Added action window access rules

4. **`models/__init__.py`**
   - Added imports for all model files

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Backup Database**: Ensure current database is backed up
2. **Update Module**: Install/upgrade the order_status_override module
3. **User Assignment**: Assign users to appropriate security groups:
   - `group_sales_manager_enhanced` for sales managers
   - `group_order_status_admin` for system administrators
4. **Test Commission Logic**: Verify commission calculations work correctly
5. **Test Action Windows**: Confirm no more access warnings

## ‚úÖ Validation Results

- ‚úÖ Net commission formula validated with 5 test cases
- ‚úÖ Commission percentage calculations tested
- ‚úÖ Field structure verified complete
- ‚úÖ XML/CSV syntax validated
- ‚úÖ Security access rights properly configured

## üîç Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create sales order with commission rates
- [ ] Verify commission amounts calculate correctly
- [ ] Test net commission formula with different scenarios
- [ ] Confirm action window access works for sales users
- [ ] Validate all workflow buttons function properly
- [ ] Test commission calculation stage transition

## üìû Support

For any issues with the implementation:
1. Check Odoo logs for specific error messages
2. Verify user group assignments
3. Confirm module upgrade completed successfully
4. Test with simple commission scenarios first
