# Commission Email Template Fix Summary

Generated on: 2025-08-17 12:54:37

## Issue Description
```
AttributeError: 'purchase.order' object has no attribute 'agent1_partner_id'
```

The error occurs when email templates try to access `object.agent1_partner_id.name` on purchase order objects, but these fields don't exist directly on the purchase order model.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Email templates** are trying to access sale order fields directly on purchase order objects
2. **Missing computed fields** in the purchase.order model to bridge the gap
3. **Lack of conditional logic** in email templates to handle missing fields gracefully

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Purchase Order Model Enhancement
- ✅ Added computed fields: `agent1_partner_id`, `agent2_partner_id`, `project_id`, `unit_id`
- ✅ Fields compute from `origin_so_id` relationship
- ✅ Proper error handling for missing relationships

### 2. Safe Email Templates
- ✅ Created new templates with conditional logic
- ✅ Added `hasattr()` checks for field existence
- ✅ Implemented fallback values for missing fields
- ✅ OSUS branding and professional design

### 3. CloudPepper Deployment
- ✅ Generated SQL fix script for CloudPepper
- ✅ Backup strategy for existing templates
- ✅ Step-by-step deployment instructions

## Issues Found: 0


## Next Steps for CloudPepper
1. **Backup existing templates**
2. **Disable problematic templates**
