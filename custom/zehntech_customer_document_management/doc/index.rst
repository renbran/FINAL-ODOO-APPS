**Key Features**
================================================================
 
- **Upload and Manage Documents**: The Upload and Manage Customer Documents feature is essential for maintaining accurate and organized customer records. This feature allows users to upload documents directly from the Contacts form, set expiry dates, specify notification emails, and assign categories and tags. Customers can digitally sign documents, attach URLs from Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive, and upload files in formats such as PDF, PNG, DOC, DOCX, and Excel.
- **Track and Filter Documents**: The Track and Filter Documents feature offers a centralized list of all customer documents with status indicators like Expired, Expiring Soon, Valid, and Not Expired. Users can filter by categories and tags, and export records for reporting.
- **Automating Document Expiry Email Notifications**: This feature automates email notifications for document expiration, sending reminders at three key stages: a customizable number of days before expiry, on the expiry date, and after the document expires, ensuring timely alerts and seamless document management.
- **Expiry Reminder with Custom Time**: This feature allows administrators to globally configure how many days before and after a document’s expiry email reminders should be sent, along with the exact time of day for sending notifications, ensuring consistent and timely alerts across all documents.
- **Expiry Status Dashboard with Visual Insights**: This interactive dashboard provides a clear visual overview of all documents, showing totals and breaking them down into expired, not expired, and those expiring within the next 7 days—helping users track document status at a glance and take timely action.
- **Document Status Overview**: Quickly view and manage documents by status—Total, Expired, Not Expired, and Expiring Soon (7 Days)—with clickable filters that open detailed document lists for instant access and tracking.
