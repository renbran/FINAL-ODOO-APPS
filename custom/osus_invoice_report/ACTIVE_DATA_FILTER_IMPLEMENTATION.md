# Active Data Filter Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to ensure that the OSUS Invoice Report module only fetches and displays active (non-cancelled) data throughout the system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Model Layer Updates

#### `models/custom_invoice.py`
- **QR Code Generation**: Added check to skip QR code generation for cancelled invoices
- **Sale Order Population**: Modified `_populate_from_sale_order()` to only fetch non-cancelled sale orders
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures cancelled records don't interfere with QR code and related data processing

```python
# Skip QR code generation for cancelled records
if record.state == 'cancel':
    record.qr_image = False
    continue

# Only fetch active sale orders
sale_order = self.env['sale.order'].search([
    ('name', '=', vals.get('invoice_origin')),
    ('state', '!=', 'cancel')  # Exclude cancelled orders
], limit=1)
```

#### `models/report_custom_bill.py`
- **Report Data Filtering**: Filter out cancelled account moves in report generation
```python
docs = self.env['account.move'].browse(docids).filtered(lambda m: m.state != 'cancel')
```

#### `models/report_custom_invoice.py`
- **Report Data Filtering**: Filter out cancelled account moves in report generation
```python
docs = self.env['account.move'].browse(docids).filtered(lambda m: m.state != 'cancel')
```

### 2. View Layer Updates

#### `views/account_move_views.xml`
- **Added Active Data Filters**:
  - "Active Only" filter: `[('state', '!=', 'cancel')]`
  - "Posted Only" filter: `[('state', '=', 'posted')]`
- **Updated Action Domains**:
  - Invoice List Action: Added `('state', '!=', 'cancel')` to domain
  - Property Deals Dashboard: Added `('state', '!=', 'cancel')` to domain
- **Default Filter Context**: Added `'search_default_active_only': 1` to automatically apply active filter

#### `views/sale_order_views.xml`
- **Added Active Data Filters**:
  - "Active Only" filter: `[('state', '!=', 'cancel')]`
  - "Confirmed Orders" filter: `[('state', 'in', ['sale', 'done'])]`

### 3. Data Flow Protection

#### Key Areas Protected:
1. **QR Code Generation**: Cancelled invoices will not generate QR codes
2. **Report Generation**: PDF reports will only include active invoices
3. **Data Population**: When creating invoices from sale orders, only active sale orders are considered
4. **List Views**: Default filters exclude cancelled records
5. **Dashboard Views**: Analytics and reporting exclude cancelled data

### 4. User Experience Improvements

#### Enhanced Filtering Options:
- Users can now easily filter for active-only data
- Separate filters for different invoice states (Posted, Active, etc.)
- Default views automatically exclude cancelled records
- Clear visual distinction between active and historical data

#### Default Behavior:
- All main list views now default to showing only active records
- Users must explicitly choose to view cancelled records if needed
- Reports and exports only include active data by default

## Benefits

### Data Integrity
- Ensures cancelled transactions don't appear in reports
- Prevents confusion between active and cancelled deals
- Maintains accuracy in financial reporting

### Performance
- Reduces data set size by excluding cancelled records
- Faster loading times for lists and reports
- More efficient searches and filters

### User Experience
- Cleaner interface with relevant data only
- Reduced clutter from cancelled transactions
- More accurate business insights

## Implementation Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Users can still access cancelled records if needed
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### State Management
- Uses standard Odoo state field ('cancel' state)
- Consistent with Odoo's built-in state management
- Works with existing workflow processes

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of edge cases
- Proper logging for troubleshooting
- Fallback mechanisms for data integrity

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify Active Filtering**: Test that cancelled records are properly excluded
2. **Report Generation**: Ensure reports only show active data
3. **QR Code Generation**: Confirm QR codes are not generated for cancelled records
4. **Filter Functionality**: Test all new filter options work correctly
5. **Data Population**: Verify sale order to invoice data flow excludes cancelled orders

## Future Enhancements

1. **Archive Functionality**: Consider adding archive states for better data management
2. **Audit Trail**: Implement audit logging for state changes
3. **Bulk Operations**: Add bulk operations for state management
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Additional filter options for specific business needs
