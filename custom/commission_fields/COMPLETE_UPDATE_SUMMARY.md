external_commission_type, external_percentage, external_fixed_amount
broker_agency_commission_type, broker_agency_rate, broker_agency_total
# etc.

# New (simplified)
broker_agency_rate + broker_agency_amount
referral_rate + referral_amount  
cashback_rate + cashback_amount
other_external_rate + other_external_amount
```

### Internal Commission Fields
```python
# Old (removed)
internal_commission_type
agent1_commission_type, agent1_rate, agent1_fixed, agent1_commission
# etc.

# New (simplified)
agent1_rate + agent1_amount
agent2_rate + agent2_amount
manager_rate + manager_amount
director_rate + director_amount
```

### New Summary Fields
```python
gross_commission_base      # Base amount (sale value)
total_external_allocation  # Sum of all external commissions
total_internal_allocation  # Sum of all internal commissions  
total_company_net         # Base - total commissions
grand_total_commission    # Total of all commissions
