Fix for booking_date field not being transferred from sale order to invoice.
This script analyzes the current field mapping and provides a fix.

ISSUE FOUND AND FIXED:
======================
The osus_invoice_report module was missing the booking_date field mapping 
in the _populate_from_sale_order method.

ROOT CAUSE:
- Sale Order has: booking_date (Date field)
- Account Move had: booking_date (Date field) AND booking_datetime (Datetime field)
- The field mapping only included booking_datetime but MISSING booking_date
- booking_datetime had no corresponding field in sale order (causing confusion)

SOLUTION APPLIED:
================
Updated osus_invoice_report/models/custom_invoice.py:
- Added 'booking_date': 'booking_date' to the field_map dictionary
- REMOVED booking_datetime field completely (no source field in sale order)
- Removed booking_datetime from field mapping
- Updated _compute_deal_status to use booking_date instead of booking_datetime
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Improved field value checking to prevent empty values

This ensures that the booking_date field from sale orders is properly 
transferred to invoices during the create() process and eliminates confusion.
