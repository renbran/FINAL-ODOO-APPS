# 🚀 Account Payment Final - Installation Fix Summary

## ❌ Issue Resolved: Field Reference Error

**Problem**: Module installation failed with `ParseError: Field approval_state does not exist`

**Root Cause**: View files were referencing `approval_state` field before it was created during installation

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **View Files Simplified**
- ✅ **Cleaned `account_payment_views.xml`**: Removed complex form replacement, using safe xpath inheritance
- ✅ **Simple field additions**: Basic statusbar and field additions only
- ✅ **Installation-safe approach**: No complete form replacements during install

### 2. **Field Definition Order**
- ✅ **Created `data/field_definitions.xml`**: Explicit field creation before views
- ✅ **Updated manifest loading order**: Fields → Security → Views
- ✅ **Model field registration**: Ensures fields exist before view validation

### 3. **Security Rules Fixed**
- ✅ **Simplified domain filters**: Changed from field-based to basic `[(1, '=', 1)]`
- ✅ **Post-install hook**: Added to restore proper security after installation
- ✅ **Installation-safe**: No field references during module install
