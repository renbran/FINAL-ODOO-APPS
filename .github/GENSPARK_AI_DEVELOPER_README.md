## Available Scripts

The AI integration leverages existing emergency and validation scripts:

### CloudPepper Deployment
- `cloudpepper_deployment_final_validation.py`
- `create_emergency_cloudpepper_fix.py`
- `create_commission_ax_emergency_deployment.py`

### Commission System
- `create_commission_email_emergency_fix.py`
- `validate_commission_enhancement.py`
- `commission_ax_emergency_cloudpepper_fix.py`

### General Validation
- `validate_order_net_commission.py`
- `final_order_net_commission_verification.py`
- `workspace_cleanup_tool.py`

## Configuration

The AI behavior is configured through `.github/genspark-ai-config.yml`:

```yaml
ai_enabled: true
