🚨 STEP-BY-STEP NUCLEAR FIX for web.assets_backend error

PROBLEM: Database contains cached XML template inheritance data that references 
the old assets.xml structure we removed. Even during fresh installation, 
Odoo finds this cached data and tries to process it.

SOLUTION: Complete nuclear removal and fresh installation

📋 METHOD 1: Database Direct Access (Fastest)
1. Access your PostgreSQL database directly:
   psql -U odoo -d your_database_name

2. Copy and paste ALL contents of nuclear_cleanup_payment.sql
   (This will remove every trace of the module)

3. Restart Odoo service completely

4. Go to Odoo Apps → Update Apps List

5. Search "payment_account_enhanced" → Click Install (not Upgrade)

📋 METHOD 2: Odoo Shell (Safer but slower)
1. Stop Odoo service

2. Run Odoo shell:
   python odoo-bin shell -d your_database_name

3. Copy and paste ALL contents of nuclear_cleanup_payment.py

4. Exit shell and restart Odoo

5. Install module fresh

📋 METHOD 3: Manual UI + Database (Hybrid)
1. In Odoo Apps, try to Uninstall the module (if button exists)

2. If uninstall works: Great! Then install fresh

3. If uninstall fails: Use METHOD 1 (SQL cleanup)

🔍 WHY NUCLEAR APPROACH?
- Normal uninstall may not clear XML template cache
- Asset inheritance creates deep database dependencies  
- Fresh install needs completely clean slate
- Cached ir_qweb and ir_ui_view data causes conflicts

✅ AFTER NUCLEAR CLEANUP:
- Module will install with manifest-based assets only
- No XML template inheritance conflicts
- All CSS/JS will load from __manifest__.py assets section
- Error will be permanently resolved

⚠️  WARNING: This removes ALL module data! 
If you have important payment data, backup first!
