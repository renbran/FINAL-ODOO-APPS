# CloudPepper RPC Error - Immediate Actions
# If you want to resolve this without external support

## Quick Browser-Side Fix (Try First):

1. **Hard Refresh**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Clear Browser Cache**: 
   - Chrome: Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data
   - Firefox: Settings > Privacy > Clear Data
3. **Disable Browser Extensions** temporarily
4. **Try Incognito/Private Mode**

## The JavaScript fixes are already applied to your local files.

## If Browser Fix Doesn't Work:

The RPC error suggests server-side issues. Since the emergency fix script has already:
- ✅ Fixed 12 JavaScript syntax errors
- ✅ Generated database fix scripts
- ✅ Cleared local caches
- ✅ Created backup

The remaining issue is likely server-side caching or the database fixes need to be applied to CloudPepper.

## Alternative: Test Local Development:

If you want to verify the fixes work, you can test locally:
```bash
# Use the available Docker task
docker-compose exec odoo odoo --test-enable --log-level=test --stop-after-init -d odoo -i account_payment_final
```

This will confirm your code fixes are working before dealing with CloudPepper deployment.
