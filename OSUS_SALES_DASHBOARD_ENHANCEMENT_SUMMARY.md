# OSUS Sales Dashboard Enhancement Summary

## Overview
The `oe_sale_dashboard_17` module has been comprehensively reviewed and enhanced with several fixes and new features as requested.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Doughnut Chart Data Issues
**Problem:** The doughnut chart was not picking the right numbers for revenue distribution.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced data validation in `_createRevenueDistributionChart()` method
- Added fallback logic to use `amount` field when `invoiced_amount` is zero or invalid
- Improved filtering to exclude invalid data entries
- Added debug logging to track data flow
- Enhanced chart data validation with proper error handling

**Changes Made:**
```javascript
// Before: Simple data mapping
data: invoicedData.map(item => item.invoiced_amount || 0)

// After: Smart fallback with validation
data: invoicedData.map(item => {
    const value = (item.invoiced_amount && item.invoiced_amount > 0) 
        ? item.invoiced_amount 
        : (item.amount || 0);
    return value;
})
```
