# OSUS Comprehensive Greetings - Email Template Fix Summary

## ✅ **Template Issues Fixed**

### 🔧 **Problem:**
- Anniversary email templates were using `{{ object.years_of_service }}` field
- This field wasn't available because the module wasn't properly installed/updated
- Templates were failing with AttributeError: "'hr.employee' object has no attribute 'years_of_service'"

### 🛠️ **Solution Applied:**
Removed all `years_of_service` references from email templates and replaced with generic text:

#### **Personal Anniversary Template:**
- ❌ **Before**: "🏆 Happy {{ object.years_of_service }} Year Work Anniversary"
- ✅ **After**: "🏆 Happy Work Anniversary"
- ❌ **Before**: "{{ object.years_of_service or '1' }} Year anniversary"
- ✅ **After**: "Work Anniversary" (generic text)

#### **Anniversary Announcement Template:**
- ❌ **Before**: "🏆 Celebrating {{ object.name }}'s {{ object.years_of_service }} Year Work Anniversary"
- ✅ **After**: "🏆 Celebrating {{ object.name }}'s Work Anniversary"
- ❌ **Before**: Complex conditional logic based on years
- ✅ **After**: Simple, reliable text

### 📧 **Template Status After Fix:**

1. **mail_template_birthday_personal** ✅ Working
2. **mail_template_birthday_announcement** ✅ Working
3. **mail_template_anniversary_personal** ✅ Should now work (no computed field dependencies)
4. **mail_template_anniversary_announcement** ✅ Should now work (no computed field dependencies)

### 🎯 **Benefits:**

- **Reliability**: Templates no longer depend on computed fields that might not be available
- **Immediate Deployment**: Can be deployed without waiting for module updates
- **Cleaner Design**: Generic anniversary text works for all employees
- **Error-Free**: No more template rendering failures

### 🚀 **Ready for Testing**

The updated templates should now work correctly on CloudPepper. Run the test script again to verify all 4 templates send successfully without errors.

**Note**: If you want specific years to be shown, the module will need to be properly installed/updated first to make the `years_of_service` computed field available in the database.
