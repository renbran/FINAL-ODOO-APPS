# 🎯 Payment QR Code Verification System

## 📱 How It Works

The OSUS Payment Account Enhanced module now includes a **complete QR code verification system** that allows anyone to scan payment voucher QR codes and verify payment authenticity in real-time.

## 🔍 QR Code Verification Process

### 1. **QR Code Generation**
- Each payment voucher automatically generates a unique QR code
- QR code contains either:
  - **Verification URL**: `https://yoursite.com/payment/verify/12345`
  - **Payment Details**: Structured text with payment info for manual verification

### 2. **Scanning the QR Code**
When someone scans the QR code with any smartphone:

```
📱 User scans QR code
    ↓
🌐 Browser opens verification URL
    ↓
✅ Payment details displayed securely
```

### 3. **Verification Page Features**

#### ✅ **Success Page** (`/payment/verify/{payment_id}`)
Displays:
- **Voucher Number**: DRAFT-PV-000001 or PV-000001
- **Payment Amount**: 1,500.00 AED
- **Payment To**: Partner/Vendor name
- **Payment Date**: 2025-08-06
- **Status**: ✅ Verified & Posted or ⏳ Draft
- **Payment Type**: Outbound/Inbound Payment
- **Company**: OSUS Properties
- **Journal**: Bank/Cash journal
- **Verification Timestamp**: Real-time verification

#### ❌ **Error Page** (for invalid/missing payments)
Shows:
- Clear error message
- Error code for troubleshooting
- Instructions for users
- Link to verification guide

### 4. **Public Access Points**

| URL | Purpose | Access |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `/payment/verify/{id}` | Main verification page | Public |
| `/payment/verify/api/{id}` | JSON API for mobile apps | Public |
| `/payment/qr-guide` | User guide and instructions | Public |
