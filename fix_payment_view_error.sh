echo "The XML view error has been fixed:"
echo "‚ùå Error: Field 'state' used in modifier 'invisible' must be present in view but is missing"
echo "‚úÖ Solution: Added invisible 'state' field to view for inherited compatibility"

echo "Changes Made:"
echo "============="
echo "üìÅ account_payment_views.xml:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Added: <field name=\"state\" invisible=\"1\"/> in header"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Added: <field name=\"state\" invisible=\"1\"/> in notebook"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Added: <field name=\"company_id\" invisible=\"1\"/> for additional compatibility"

echo "Why this fix works:"
echo "==================="
echo "‚Ä¢ Odoo requires fields used in modifiers to be present in the view"
echo "‚Ä¢ Some inherited views reference the base 'state' field"
echo "‚Ä¢ Adding invisible fields satisfies this requirement without affecting UI"
echo "‚Ä¢ The 'state' field is now available for any inherited view modifiers"

echo "To apply the fix, update the module:"
echo "docker-compose exec odoo odoo --update=payment_account_enhanced --stop-after-init"

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ The database initialization error should now be resolved!"
