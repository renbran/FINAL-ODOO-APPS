# CloudPepper Installation Guide for Payment Approval Workflow

## âœ… Import Error Fixed

The critical import error you encountered has been resolved:

**Error:** `ImportError: cannot import name 'safe_str_cmp' from 'werkzeug.security'`

**Fix Applied:** Changed the import in `controllers/portal.py` from:
```python
from werkzeug.security import safe_str_cmp as consteq
```

To:
```python
from odoo.tools import consteq
```

This uses Odoo's built-in secure comparison function instead of the deprecated werkzeug function.
