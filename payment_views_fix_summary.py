ACCOUNT_PAYMENT_VIEWS.XML FIX SUMMARY
====================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
==================
- RPC_ERROR in account_payment_views.xml at line 92
- Problematic XPath: //group (too generic, cannot locate target)
- Also found manifest file references to non-existent files

SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:
====================
✅ FIXED: XPath expression in account_payment_views.xml
   - Changed: //group
   - To: //group[@expand='0']
   - This targets the specific group used for search grouping options

✅ FIXED: Manifest file references
   - Changed: 'views/payment_report_wizard_views.xml'
   - To: 'views/payment_report_wizard.xml'
   
   - Changed: 'reports/enhanced_payment_report.xml'
   - To: 'reports/payment_summary_report.xml'

FILES MODIFIED:
==============
1. account_payment_approval/views/account_payment_views.xml (line 112)
2. account_payment_approval/__manifest__.py (lines 53 and 59)

VALIDATION RESULTS:
==================
✅ XML syntax is valid
✅ All file references in manifest now match actual files
✅ XPath expression is now specific and should locate target correctly
✅ No more generic //group expressions

EXPECTED RESULT:
===============
✅ Module should now install without RPC_ERROR
✅ Search view enhancements should work properly
✅ Groupby options should be available in payment search

STATUS: ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
