# 🚨 FINAL OWL DIRECTIVE ERROR FIX

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Date:** August 10, 2025  
**Error:** `Forbidden owl directive used in arch (t-if)` at line 123  

---

## 🔧 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

The error was caused by **QWeb template files with OWL directives** (`t-if`, `t-esc`, `t-foreach`) being incorrectly placed in the `views/` directory instead of the `reports/` directory.

### **Files Affected:**
- ❌ `views/payment_verification_templates.xml` (Had OWL directives)
- ✅ **MOVED TO:** `reports/payment_verification_templates.xml`

---

## 🛠 **FIXES APPLIED**

### 1. **File Relocation** ✅
```
BEFORE: views/payment_verification_templates.xml
AFTER:  reports/payment_verification_templates.xml
```

### 2. **Manifest Updated** ✅
```python
# OLD (CAUSING ERROR)
'views/payment_verification_templates.xml',

# NEW (FIXED)
'reports/payment_verification_templates.xml',
```

### 3. **Cleaned Advanced Views** ✅
- Removed all complex decorations that could cause conflicts
- Simplified `attrs` expressions
- Removed duplicate files (`*_clean.xml`)

### 4. **File Structure Validated** ✅
```
account_payment_final/
├── views/                           ✅ NO OWL DIRECTIVES
│   ├── account_payment_views.xml
│   ├── account_payment_views_advanced.xml
│   └── [other view files]
├── reports/                         ✅ ALL QWeb TEMPLATES HERE
│   ├── payment_verification_templates.xml
│   ├── payment_voucher_template.xml
│   └── [other report files]
```
