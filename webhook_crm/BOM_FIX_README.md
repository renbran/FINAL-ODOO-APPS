# BOM Character Fix Applied

## Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: SyntaxError due to BOM (U+FEFF) character in Python files
- **Error**: `SyntaxError: invalid non-printable character U+FEFF`
- **Impact**: HTTP request handling failures in Odoo

## Files Fixed
- `__manifest__.py` - Removed BOM character from manifest file
- `__init__.py` - Removed BOM character from main init file  
- `models/__init__.py` - Removed BOM character from models init file
- All other Python files in controllers/ and models/ directories

## Fix Applied
- Re-encoded all Python files to UTF-8 without BOM using PowerShell
- Used `Get-Content | Out-File -Encoding utf8` to remove BOM characters
- Verified proper encoding for CloudPepper hosting compatibility

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Module should now load properly without syntax errors

## Next Steps
1. Restart Odoo instance on CloudPepper
2. Update/reinstall the webhook_crm module
3. Verify no more HTTP request handling errors in logs
