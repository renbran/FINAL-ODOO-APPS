OSUS Invoice Report Module - Upgrade Summary
===========================================

This script summarizes the fixes applied to make the OSUS Invoice Report module upgradable.

Fixed Issues:
1. ✓ action_print_custom_invoice is not a valid action on account.move
   - Fixed by adding proper action methods in account_move.py
   - Fixed report action references to use correct IDs

2. ✓ booking_date field not defined
   - Field is properly defined in custom_invoice.py
   - Removed duplicate field definitions to avoid conflicts

3. ✓ XML parsing errors
   - Fixed report_custom_invoice_modern.xml (removed leading whitespace)
   - Fixed report_receipt.xml (removed content after closing </odoo> tag)

4. ✓ Missing model imports
   - Fixed models/__init__.py to import existing models only
   - Removed reference to non-existent report_custom_receipt.py

5. ✓ Report action references
   - Updated action methods to use correct report IDs
   - Cleaned up __manifest__.py to include only existing files

Module Structure:
===============
✓ All XML files are valid
✓ All Python files compile successfully  
✓ All required fields are properly defined
✓ Report actions are correctly configured
✓ Dependencies are properly declared

The module should now be upgradable and functional.

Key Features:
