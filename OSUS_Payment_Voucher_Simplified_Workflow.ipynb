    "- **Simplified 2-State Workflow**: Draft → Waiting for Approval → Approved & Posted\n",
    "- **Automatic Voucher Number Generation**: Visible immediately upon creation\n",
    "- **Organized UI**: Clean notebook-style interface with grouped sections\n",
    "- **Real-time Status Updates**: Frontend JavaScript ensures UI responsiveness\n",
    "- **QR Code Integration**: For payment verification\n",
